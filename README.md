# Fisher-s-Exact-Test-Chi-Squared-Test-A-B-Testing-
In this project, I collected the web analytics results of A/B testing performed on 2 groups of website users. I wanted to compare the efficacy of 2 different web ad layouts by randomly showing them to 2 groups of users. Bearing in mind that computation of p-values would depend on the distribution of the data samples, here I decided to explore the test stats for discrete metrics (such as click-through rate, conversion rates, bounce rates etc). These include Fisher's exact test and Chi-squared test


Null hypothesis: Both ad designs are equivalently efficients i.e both variables/samples are independent
